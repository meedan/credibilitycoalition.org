        <h3>A Structured Response to Misinformation: Defining and Annotating Credibility Indicators in News Articles</h3>

        <p>The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by automated feeds and social media are a growing concern. While there have been calls for an increased effort to improve the detection of and response to misinformation, doing so effectively requires collective agreement on the indicators that signal credible content. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined collaboratively by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an articleâ€™s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a novel dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our credibility indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. Finally, we outline the future steps for this initiative, including expanding annotation efforts, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.</p>
