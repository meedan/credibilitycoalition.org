    description: |+
      The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by platforms are a growing concern, leading to numerous efforts to improve the detection of and response to misinformation. Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article’s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

      ## We Advance Standards

      Our community advances ideation and exchange around credibility standards in order to support cooperative solutions that involve technologists, industry and institutions in a variety of ways, including:

      ### Indicator Development
      Our research community develops definitions for indicators or signals (units of information that may factor into machine approaches to reduce misinformation or to promote online information quality).

      ### Microgrants
      We administer microgrants that test credibility signals and indicators in standards research that encourage our recipients to offer their results for peer review.

      ## External Projects
      We support the ongoing development of indicators and signals in external projects such as CredWeb, a common specification or standard for credibility signals that is conversant with members of the W3C.
