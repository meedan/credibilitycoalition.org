      The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by automated feeds and social media are a growing concern.

      Many solutions are being attempted, but the misinformation problem is so large that any single effort can only provide partial alleviation. Tackling it successfully will require a holistic approach, with reputation systems, fact-checking, media literacy, revenue models, and public feedback all helping to address the health of the information ecosystem.

      ##     COLLABORATIVE EXPLORATION IS KEY

      Together, as a coalition, we are interested in complementing these efforts by establishing ways of engagement, or *frameworks*, that encourage interdisciplinarity and cooperation. We think that this is key given the complicated nature of the problem.

      Rather than jointly deciding whether an article is “credible” or “not credible” or endorsing any single index or evaluation of credibility, the Credibility Coalition fosters the development of frameworks around which credibility that foster the generation of better standards, rigorous research, and thoughtful application around information quality. [More about our frameworks can be found here](https://credibilitycoalition.org/approach/ "Approach").

      ## OUR DRIVING QUESTIONS
      Our efforts are currently directed by three main questions. Our energies are focused on how to:

      - __Assess__: Can we agree on the indicators for reliable information online?
      - __Scale__: Does assessment work at both small and large magnitudes?
      - __Apply__: How can the implementation of credibility standards inform effectively?

      ## OUR HISTORY
      The Credibility Coalition is an initiative co-founded by Meedan and Hacks/Hackers. We were incubated at the first [MisinfoCon](https://misinfocon.com/) in early 2017 and grew under a [Knight Prototype Fund Grant](https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-prototype-fund-awards-1-million-to-20-projects-to-improve-the-flow-of-accurate-information) focused on improving the flow of accurate information.

      We have presented our initiative in a number of international venues to gain feedback and partners; recent examples include the [Mozilla Festival 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/), the [International Press Telecommunications Council Autumn 2017 Meeting](https://iptc.org/events/autumn-meeting-2017/), and [The Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/communications-and-society-program/recap-palo-alto-ca-forum/).

      In March 2018 we [announced the support](https://misinfocon.com/whats-next-for-the-credibility-coalition-554d0588f2bf) of Google News Lab, the Facebook Journalism Project, Craig Newmark Philanthropies and additional private donors.

      ## INDICATORS AND DATA

      Recognizing the complexity of developing standards, the Credibility Coalition approaches them through rigorous research.

      We have three major outputs: (1) an annotation guide that can be used for future studies and that can inform larger studies for annotation, (2) a developing, licensed data set of findings, and (3) a vocabulary document developed with the W3C Credible Web Community Group. Recognizing that our information landscape is constantly changing, each of these outputs is regularly updated and developed.

      ## WORKING GROUPS
      Fostering productive discussion and exploration around the assessment of credibility is the heart of our research community, and working groups serve as the heart of its participatory structure. A working group fosters discussions among community members in ways that grapple around the central questions of the Credibility Coalition. These small working groups gather around themes that are inherently interdisciplinary. We look for ideas that basically demand people of different expertises and backgrounds to come together and foster creative brainstorming around an issue or question.

      Topics of our initial working groups include: *The UX of Credible Content, Health Misinformation, Do Indicators Translate (EN-ES)?, Economics of Misinformation*

      ## STRATEGIC MAPPING OF EFFORTS ("MISINFOMAP")
      A map of information disorder efforts can foster interdisciplinary thinking — helping content creators think longer term, with those building infrastructure and facilitating connections between cutting edge research and robust practice.

      The map, with additional projects and efforts, has been further developed during [a number of workshops](https://misinfocon.com/our-toolkit-for-people-and-teams-tackling-misinformation-online-9e6d240f3136), including at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and with the W3C Credible Web Community Group.

      is no longer enough. We believe that it is crucial for researchers, journalists,
      and the general public to understand what parts of a story are credible and
      why. We also believe it is important to understand how to discuss credibility
      effectively.

      ## WHAT IS CREDIBILITY?
      Simply put, credibility is __information reliability__. While individual members of the Coalition may define the factors that make up information reliability with some variability, we believe that it is necessary and beneficial to work together in creating shared understandings.

      This is because the assessment of reliability is *__complex__*. Credibility is not a boolean flag, or the simple answer to a "yes/no" question.

      Credibility is related to *__accuracy__*. But our goal is not to weigh into, for example, disagreements among scientists on the precise pace of rising sea levels or historians who differ on the exact number of deaths resulting from genocidal events. There are a number of articles that are more credible than others, and these articles may be equally credible even if there’s disagreement among experts. The same applies for other items in the news, like breaking news in the wake of a natural disaster.

      There is an aspect to credibility that is a *__negotiation__*, where publishers and authors seek to convey credibility while readers and platforms seek to better ascertain it. The factors that make up credibility are related to one another in ways that are intricate and not yet well understood.

      This complexity is why we anticipate differences among particular interpretations of why one story is more credible than the next, but nonetheless believe that the structure — the relationships and signals of credibility — can be productively defined through a community effort. In fact, given the intricacies of information networks and negotiation, we believe that a collaborative and iterative approach is necessary.

      ## INDICATORS
      Central to the Credibility Coalition's endeavor is the definition and refinement of signals, or indicators for credibility.

      [Example indicators](https://credweb.org/cciv/r/1) include looking at advertisements and revenue models, the structure of an article, and how it quotes and represents outside experts and scientific literature, such as:

    description: |+
      The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by platforms are a growing concern, leading to numerous efforts to improve the detection of and response to misinformation. Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article’s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

      The Credibility Coalition is currently laying the groundwork for further explorations of article credibility on the web. We are seeking students passionate about tackling misinformation, addressing information and news credibility and understanding the role artificial intelligence plays in this sector.

      We are developing future rounds of testing data (you can find our [initial study here](https://assets.ctfassets.net/tlowcqj4pb76/4lmUdUz36gQuOKO0UOwEU2/819497f46f25a9cfcbaa7d4b5db8e354/CredCoWebConf2018.pdf) and [more info here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hGNqM_aO6U3gtryqqLZ_fTKreE940KIWlMnrfV5ooXU/)), and we are seeking help with annotating articles -- the first building block of designing artificial intelligence for information credibility. Student annotators will help develop our data by reviewing the articles and marking them up with a simple set of indicators.

      An interest in journalism is preferred, but those with any background, including engineering, computer science, politics, linguistics and sociology, can apply.

      Each annotator's work takes about 10 hours. All work is done remotely.

      Specifically, each annotator's responsibilities include:

      - Reading 50 articles (subject matter TBD). Different articles have different levels of credibility.
      - Reviewing definitions of a few indicators. For instance, we might ask you to look at an article and indicate if the article contains a clickbait headline. We’ll give you clear definitions of each indicator and how to rate them.
      - Marking up a set of indicators to measure the article’s credibility.

      Annotators will gain experience:

      - Understanding the annotation process of data gathering for artificial intelligence.
      - Analyzing biases in news content.
      - Learning the nuanced challenges of designing AI for addressing information and news credibility.


      We offer the following compensation:

      - A stipend of $150 for each annotator's efforts.
      - Academic incentives (class credit, etc).
      - If you choose, we can credit your support if we publish the data.

      To participate in an upcoming credibility study, please contact your resume on our [Handshake profile](https://app.joinhandshake.com/employers/311200) or directly to Dwight Knell, Program Lead, at [dwight@meedan.com](mailto:dwight@meedan.com).
