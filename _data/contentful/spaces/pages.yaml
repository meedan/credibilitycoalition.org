      The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by automated feeds and social media are a growing concern.

      Many solutions are being attempted, but the misinformation problem is so large that any single effort can only provide partial alleviation. Tackling it successfully will require a holistic approach, with reputation systems, fact-checking, media literacy, revenue models, and public feedback all helping to address the health of the information ecosystem.

      ##     COLLABORATIVE EXPLORATION IS KEY

      Together, as a coalition, we are interested in complementing these efforts by establishing ways of engagement, or *frameworks*, that encourage interdisciplinarity and cooperation. We think that this is key given the complicated nature of the problem.

      Rather than jointly deciding whether an article is “credible” or “not credible” or endorsing any single index or evaluation of credibility, the Credibility Coalition fosters the development of frameworks around which credibility that foster the generation of better standards, rigorous research, and thoughtful application around information quality. [More about our frameworks can be found here](https://credibilitycoalition.org/approach/ "Approach").

      ## OUR DRIVING QUESTIONS
      Our efforts are currently directed by three main questions. Our energies are focused on how to:

      - __Assess__: Can we agree on the indicators for reliable information online?
      - __Scale__: Does assessment work at both small and large magnitudes?
      - __Apply__: How can the implementation of credibility standards inform effectively?

      ## OUR HISTORY
      The Credibility Coalition is an initiative co-founded by Meedan and Hacks/Hackers. We were incubated at the first [MisinfoCon](https://misinfocon.com/) in early 2017 and grew under a [Knight Prototype Fund Grant](https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-prototype-fund-awards-1-million-to-20-projects-to-improve-the-flow-of-accurate-information) focused on improving the flow of accurate information.

      We have presented our initiative in a number of international venues to gain feedback and partners; recent examples include the [Mozilla Festival 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/), the [International Press Telecommunications Council Autumn 2017 Meeting](https://iptc.org/events/autumn-meeting-2017/), and [The Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/communications-and-society-program/recap-palo-alto-ca-forum/).

      In March 2018 we [announced the support](https://misinfocon.com/whats-next-for-the-credibility-coalition-554d0588f2bf) of Google News Lab, the Facebook Journalism Project, Craig Newmark Philanthropies and additional private donors.

      ## INDICATORS AND DATA

      Recognizing the complexity of developing standards, the Credibility Coalition approaches them through rigorous research.

      We have three major outputs: (1) an annotation guide that can be used for future studies and that can inform larger studies for annotation, (2) a developing, licensed data set of findings, and (3) a vocabulary document developed with the W3C Credible Web Community Group. Recognizing that our information landscape is constantly changing, each of these outputs is regularly updated and developed.

      Examples of our workshops include:

      - [Closed Messaging Spaces: Thinking About Best Practices and Ethics in a Global Environment](https://misinfocon.com/closed-messaging-spaces-thinking-about-best-practices-and-ethics-in-a-global-environment-10fc82191743)

      ## WORKING GROUPS
      Fostering productive discussion and exploration around the assessment of credibility is the heart of our research community, and working groups serve as the heart of its participatory structure. A working group fosters discussions among community members in ways that grapple around the central questions of the Credibility Coalition. These small working groups gather around themes that are inherently interdisciplinary. We look for ideas that basically demand people of different expertises and backgrounds to come together and foster creative brainstorming around an issue or question.

      Topics of our initial working groups include: *The UX of Credible Content, Health Misinformation, Do Indicators Translate (EN-ES)?, Economics of Misinformation*

      ## STRATEGIC MAPPING OF EFFORTS ("MISINFOMAP")
      A map of information disorder efforts can foster interdisciplinary thinking — helping content creators think longer term, with those building infrastructure and facilitating connections between cutting edge research and robust practice.

      The map, with additional projects and efforts, has been further developed during [a number of workshops](https://misinfocon.com/our-toolkit-for-people-and-teams-tackling-misinformation-online-9e6d240f3136), including at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism and with the W3C Credible Web Community Group.

      ## WHAT IS CREDIBILITY?
      Simply put, credibility is __information reliability__. While individual members of the Coalition may define the factors that make up information reliability with some variability, we believe that it is necessary and beneficial to work together in creating shared understandings.

      This is because the assessment of reliability is *__complex__*. Credibility is not a boolean flag, or the simple answer to a "yes/no" question.

      Credibility is related to *__accuracy__*. But our goal is not to weigh into, for example, disagreements among scientists on the precise pace of rising sea levels or historians who differ on the exact number of deaths resulting from genocidal events. There are a number of articles that are more credible than others, and these articles may be equally credible even if there’s disagreement among experts. The same applies for other items in the news, like breaking news in the wake of a natural disaster.

      There is an aspect to credibility that is a *__negotiation__*, where publishers and authors seek to convey credibility while readers and platforms seek to better ascertain it. The factors that make up credibility are related to one another in ways that are intricate and not yet well understood.

      This complexity is why we anticipate differences among particular interpretations of why one story is more credible than the next, but nonetheless believe that the structure — the relationships and signals of credibility — can be productively defined through a community effort. In fact, given the intricacies of information networks and negotiation, we believe that a collaborative and iterative approach is necessary.

      ## INDICATORS
      Central to the Credibility Coalition's endeavor is the definition and refinement of signals, or indicators for credibility.

      [Example indicators](https://credweb.org/cciv/r/1) include looking at advertisements and revenue models, the structure of an article, and how it quotes and represents outside experts and scientific literature, such as:

    description: "As news increasingly moves online, search rankings, online traffic
      metrics and website referrals matter a great deal to the bottom lines of many
      local news operations. It is not only important that these local outlets get
      credit for their reporting; ranking higher in search results can help justify
      the resources they invest in newsgathering and reinforce their image as an authoritative,
      trusted source for readers.\n\nFailing to surface their content has become another
      setback for local news outlets already struggling with cutbacks, shrinking subscription
      bases, and increasing pressure to produce more content with ever-dwindling resources.
      A vibrant local news landscape plays a vital role in keeping the public informed
      on issues that directly impact their lives. If local outlets can’t reach readers
      online, the whole news ecosystem suffers.\n\nIn early 2021, the Credibility
      Coalition, in partnership with the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
      convened a series of conversations aimed at both establishing a common vocabulary
      for greater understanding between local news outlets and online platforms and
      examining the way local news is surfaced online. \n\nThe project, which received
      financial support from the Google News Initiative, is part of a wider effort
      to empower journalists to better understand — and platforms to better execute
      — the promotion of quality local journalism on news delivery platforms.\n\nThe
      Schema-Online Local News discussion group consisted of journalists from a variety
      of outlets (with majority representation from local news operations), and representatives
      of several of the major tech platforms. \nOver the course of three meetings,
      the group examined ways that journalists might better adapt local content to
      effectively communicate with platform technologies. At the same time, they looked
      at ways platforms might improve systems for identifying local news and tweaking
      their algorithms to place local stories more prominently in front of readers.\n\nBridging
      the Divide Between Local News and Online Platforms, by the Credibility Coalition
      and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, captures some of the insights,
      ideas, and suggestions that came out of these discussions.\n"

    description: |-
      This document is meant to be used as a curriculum that empowers journalists to better understand — and help platforms to better execute — the discovery and ranking of quality local journalism on news delivery platforms.

      Journalists from local news outlets and representatives from technology platforms participated in one introductory training module and three subsequent discussion sessions. Participants worked together in small groups to brainstorm ideas, processes or mechanisms they think platforms should adopt to better surface local news. At the end of the discussion series, these ideas were refined and submitted to platforms for consideration.

      In order to facilitate these conversations, both journalists and platform representatives needed to be able to understand and use common vocabulary around news algorithms. This vocabulary, and in particular the way it represents how online information is organized and processed, can be known as a “schema.” Schemas are unfamiliar to many journalists, but nonetheless have a huge impact on their work and how it is distributed.

      __What This Curriculum Covers__

      This document provides a hands-on introduction to practical applications of schemas for online news, including:

      - Structured data
      - Rich snippets
      - Schemas for online news articles
      - Applying schema markup and Schema.org markup
      - New initiatives to markup news content
      - Signals, indicators, and ranking factors
      - Labels

      Additional resources for further exploring how local news is distributed online
      An Introduction to Schemas for Journalists was developed as part of the Schema-Online Local News discussion series that was convened over several months in 2021, by the Credibility Coalition and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, and with financial support from the Google News Initiative. The purpose of this discussion series was to establish a common vocabulary for understanding between local news outlets and online platforms by convening regular, structured conversations between journalists and representatives of technology platforms.

      The proliferation of misinformation in online news and its amplification by platforms are a growing concern, leading to numerous efforts to improve the detection of and response to misinformation. Given the variety of approaches, collective agreement on the indicators that signify credible content could allow for greater collaboration and data-sharing across initiatives. In this paper, we present an initial set of indicators for article credibility defined by a diverse coalition of experts. These indicators originate from both within an article’s text as well as from external sources or article metadata. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dataset of 40 articles of varying credibility annotated with our indicators by 6 trained annotators using specialized platforms. We discuss future steps including expanding annotation, broadening the set of indicators, and considering their use by platforms and the public, towards the development of interoperable standards for content credibility.

    description: |
      Concerns about the spread of misinformation online via news articles have led to the development of many tools and processes involving human annotation of their credibility. However, much is still unknown about how different people judge news credibility or the quality or reliability of news credibility ratings from populations of varying expertise. In this work, we consider credibility ratings from two “crowd” populations: 1) students within journalism or media programs, and 2) crowd workers on UpWork, and compare them with the ratings of two sets of experts: journalists and climate scientists, on a set of 50 climate-science articles. We find that both groups’ credibility ratings have higher correlation to journalism experts compared to the science experts, with 10-15 raters to achieve convergence. We also find that raters’ gender and political leaning impact their ratings. Among article genre of news/opinion/analysis and article source leaning of left/center/right, crowd ratings were more similar to experts respectively with opinion and strong left sources.

    description: |+
      Misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. The crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups—journalism students and Upwork workers—as well as 2 expert groups—journalists and scientists—on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use—differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.

      ## We Advance Standards

      Our community advances ideation and exchange around credibility standards in order to support cooperative solutions that involve technologists, industry and institutions in a variety of ways, including:

      ### Indicator Development
      Our research community develops definitions for indicators or signals (units of information that may factor into machine approaches to reduce misinformation or to promote online information quality).

      ### Microgrants
      We administer microgrants that test credibility signals and indicators in standards research that encourage our recipients to offer their results for peer review.

      ## External Projects
      We support the ongoing development of indicators and signals in external projects such as CredWeb, a common specification or standard for credibility signals that is conversant with members of the W3C.

      2021, the Credibility Coalition, in partnership with the Nieman Foundation for
      Journalism at Harvard convened a series of conversations aimed at establishing
      greater understanding between local news outlets and online platforms, and examining
      how local news is surfaced online.\n\n*Bridging the Divide Between Local News
      and Online Platforms* captures insights and ideas from these discussions.\n\nAs
      news increasingly moves online, search rankings, online traffic metrics and
      website referrals matter a great deal to the bottom lines of many local news
      operations. It is not only important that these local outlets get credit for
      their reporting; ranking higher in search results can help justify the resources
      they invest in newsgathering and reinforce their image as an authoritative,
      trusted source for readers.\n\nFailing to surface their content has become another
      setback for local news outlets already struggling with cutbacks, shrinking subscription
      bases, and increasing pressure to produce more content with ever-dwindling resources.
      A vibrant local news landscape plays a vital role in keeping the public informed
      on issues that directly impact their lives. If local outlets can’t reach readers
      online, the whole news ecosystem suffers.\n\nThe Schema-Online Local News discussion
      series, which received financial support from the Google News Initiative, is
      part of a wider effort to empower journalists to better understand — and platforms
      to better execute — the promotion of quality local journalism on news delivery
      platforms.\n\nThe Schema discussion series group consisted of journalists from
      a variety of outlets (with majority representation from local news operations),
      and representatives of several of the major tech platforms. \n\nOver the course
      of three meetings, the group examined ways that journalists might better adapt
      local content to effectively communicate with platform technologies. At the
      same time, they looked at ways platforms might improve systems for identifying
      local news and tweaking their algorithms to place local stories more prominently
      in front of readers.\n\nBridging the Divide Between Local News and Online Platforms,
      by the Credibility Coalition and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard,
      captures some of the insights, ideas, and suggestions that came out of these
      discussions.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the assistance
      and insights of Mark Stencel,\nJoel Luther, Beck Levy, Scott Yates, Momen Bhuiyan,
      and Kate Harloe."

      This document is meant to be used as a curriculum that empowers journalists to better understand — and help platforms to better execute — the discovery and ranking of quality local journalism on news delivery platforms.

      Journalists from local news outlets and representatives from technology platforms participated in one introductory training module and three subsequent discussion sessions. Participants worked together in small groups to brainstorm ideas, processes or mechanisms they think platforms should adopt to better surface local news. At the end of the discussion series, these ideas were refined and submitted to platforms for consideration.

      In order to facilitate these conversations, both journalists and platform representatives needed to be able to understand and use common vocabulary around news algorithms. This vocabulary, and in particular the way it represents how online information is organized and processed, can be known as a “schema.” Schemas are unfamiliar to many journalists, but nonetheless have a huge impact on their work and how it is distributed.

      __What This Curriculum Covers__

      This document provides a hands-on introduction to practical applications of schemas for online news, including:

      - Structured data

      Additional resources for further exploring how local news is distributed online
      An Introduction to Schemas for Journalists was developed as part of the Schema-Online Local News discussion series that was convened over several months in 2021, by the Credibility Coalition and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, and with financial support from the Google News Initiative. The purpose of this discussion series was to establish a common vocabulary for understanding between local news outlets and online platforms by convening regular, structured conversations between journalists and representatives of technology platforms.
