      ##### How to read

      Projects are visualized as four blocks of colours that each represent a different area of focus. If a project shows a colour, that means the project may be active in that area of focus.

      For more information view our [How to Read CredCatalog document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bXZOQ-KfzHtF4EJ8iKHgLDFHItT6A7D9766YkhmbB0 "How to Read CredCatalog Document").
