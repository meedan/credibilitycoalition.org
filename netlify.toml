# Global settings applied to the whole site.  
# 
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to root of your repo),
# “command” is your build command,
# “base” is directory to change to before starting build. if you set base:
#    that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc not repo root!

[build]
  publish = "_site/"
  command = "CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master jekyll contentful --rebuild"

# Production context: All deploys to the main
# repository branch will inherit these settings.
[context.develop]
  command = "CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=develop jekyll contentful --rebuild"

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds – they do not get scoped to 
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are 
# PER-DEPLOY.

# A basic redirect rule
