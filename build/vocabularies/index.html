  <h1 class="layout--padding-top">Definitions</h1>
  
  <h4 class="layout--padding-top"> Shared and robust definitions of credibility and its indicators are required for effective solutions, whether automated processing or improved media literacy.</h4>
  
  <p>Simply rating a story as “credible” because it comes from trusted providers is no longer enough; we believe that it is crucial for researchers, journalists, and the general public to understand what parts of a story are credible and why. We also believe it is important to understand how to discuss credibility effectively.</p>
  
  <h2 class="layout--padding-top">What is credibility?</h2>
   <p>Simply put, credibility is <strong>information reliablity</strong>. But what goes into information reliability?  The individual members of the Coalition might define the factors that make up information reliablity in somewhat different ways.</p>

   <p>We find the assessment of reliability to be complex. Credibility is not a boolean flag, or the simple answer to a "yes/no" question. </p>
       
   <p>Credibility is related to <em>accuracy</em>. But our goal is not to weigh into, for example, disagreements among scientists on the precise pace of rising sea levels or historians who differ on the exact number of deaths resulting from genocidal events. Nevertheless, we agree that there are a number of articles on climate change or genocide that are more credible than others, and that these articles may be equally credible even if there’s disagreement among experts. The same applies for other items in the news, like breaking news in the wake of a natural disaster.</p>
    
   <p>Credibility is also a negotiation, where publishers and authors seek to convey credibility while readers and platforms seek to better ascertain it. The factors that make up credibility are related to one another in intricate, not yet well understood ways. </p>
    <p>This complexity is why we anticipate differences among particular interpretations of why one story is more credible than the next, but nonetheless believe that the structure &mdash; the relationships and signals of credibility &mdash; can be productively defined through a community effort.  [necessarily so note, reminder] </p>
    
 <h2 class="layout--padding-top">Indicators</h2>
   <p>At the heart of the Credibility Coalition's endeavour is the definition and refinement of the signals, or indicators, or credibility.</p>
   <p>Example indicators include: ... </p>  
   <p>Our forthcoming data model (under development) of the indicators also includes dimensions such as Authors themselves, in addition to Outlets, Publishers, or Advertisements.</p>
